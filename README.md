# Did I Choose the Right Program? Text-Mining Business Analytics Job Market
We decided to investigate whether the Master of Quantitative Management: Business Analytics Program at Duke University (the program that we are currently studying in) teaches the skills that we will actually apply in our future jobs.  

We will also analyze the reasons why certain skills required in jobs are not provided and certain courses are not necessary for future jobs. Recommendations will also be provided to improve the curriculum so that students can be better prepared for their future jobs.
